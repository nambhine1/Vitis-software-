#Software part of Enhancement of night time video using DCP based algorithm
The aim of this project is to enhance the night input frame or image to make it more clear.
The night image or frame is enhanced here using Dark Channel Prior based algorithm. Before starting make sure to install the 
OpenCV library 

- Opencv
- Python 3

This code is already tested on Jupyter notebook so you can use directly it on jupyter also......,when you use it make sure
that you mention the right input image path and the right output path otherwise this code will not work ........

Thank you
